### Ongoing Consulting

By engaging my services for a long term, you get all of the benefits of an in-house FIPS expert without investing in a full-time hire. My services are available on retainer, so you can be assured you’ll have first-priority access to FIPS knowledge and expertise exactly when you need it.

### Compliance Project Management

A FIPS compliance and validation project has a lot of moving parts: there's compliance and cryptosystem analysis, technical integration, coordination with FIPS laboratories, algorithm and functional testing, and host of other small details.

I'm available on a per-project basis to manage your overall compliance effort if you need an expert to focus your efforts and let your team members work undistracted in their own areas of expertise.

### Algorithm and Functional Testing Support

FIPS and other government compliance programs often require a battery of testing against your product and operating environment to demonstrate correct operation.

I can provide support for your testing effort by coordinating with FIPS Laboratories, working with your engineering team to establish correct testing procedures, and directly performing testing on your product in support of your compliance needs.

### Compliance Gap Analysis

You’re halfway into a contract opportunity and the dreaded question comes up: “You're FIPS compliant, right?”. You can sort through dozens of documents and standards and never find out what that means for YOUR product.

I'll work with your engineering team to analzye your current cryptosystem and tech stack, and identify all of the places where FIPS-Compliance is required, and help you create an actionable plan to reach your compliance requirements.

### Market and Solutions Analysis

There are many options to achieve FIPS compliance -- third-party vendors, open-source projects, full-service external consulting firms, and doing it all in-house. Depending on your exact situation, each of these approaches can have advantages and drawbacks.

I'll help you evaluate your needs, review the market for solutions, and deliver a detailed analysis of all your available options. I'll also assist in preparing RFPs, and can lead sales calls with solution providers to advocate for your needs and provide an unbiased evaluation of the solution offered.

### FIPS Crash Courses

Working through FIPS compliance and validation often involves nearly every part of your product team. When your organization has a baseline of FIPS knowledge, you can be assured that all of your team's efforts are moving in the right direction towards a common goal.

I can lead a seminar with your team to establish this baseline of organizational knowlege, providing targeted information that is specifically relevant to your team members and compliance needs, while leaving out the firehose of detail that's not applicable to your use case.

### Educational Resource

Having access to an outside FIPS expert is great, but having this knowlege in-house is always beneficial. If you would like to invest in cultivating FIPS expertise within your organization, I am available to work with your team through seminars, coursework, and consultation.
