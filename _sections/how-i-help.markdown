In an ideal world, you wouldn’t need me. You’d have a FIPS expert on staff who knows your products and business needs inside and out, and has the engineering and cryptographic expertise needed to keep those very different worlds aligned.

I started FIPS Outside to bridge this gap – I provide outside expertise and consulting for FIPS and US Federal Cryptographic Compliance programs.
