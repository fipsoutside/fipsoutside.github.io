title: How can I help?

I started FIPS Outside to bridge the gap between regulation and implementation. I provide engineering-focused consulting for FIPS and US Federal Cryptographic Compliance programs.

FIPS 140-3 is a highly complicated standard with many regulatory requirements that do not cleanly map to practical implementation details. Without technical expertise, a FIPS consultant may leave your engineering team scratching their heads when it comes time to build out your FIPS-compliant solution.

I bring years of practical experience in highly technical FIPS integrations, and aim to help your team achieve its regulatory, engineering, and business goals.
