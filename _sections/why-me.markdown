### An Engineer at Heart

First and foremost, I am an engineer. I have worked on countless FIPS integrations across a multitude of tech stacks. I can work directly with your engineering team to identify compliant solutions and avoid technical pitfalls in a way that a non-technical consultant simply cannot.

FIPS compliance sits at the intersection of complex regulatory issues and highly technical systems. To avoid costly setbacks and redesigns, I will work with your team to ensure that your engineering decisions are compatible with your compliance requirements.

### A FIPS and Cryptography Geek

A FIPS expert needs to know the ins and outs of FIPS regulations, cryptosystem design considerations, and all of the processes and procedures for working through a FIPS validation.

I have worked on many validations in close conjunction with multiple FIPS laboratories and vendors, analyzed product architectures and cryptosystems for compliance gaps, and performed algorithm and functional testing for a multitude of validation efforts.

### Nothing to Sell You

As a solo consultant, I can only sell you my time and expertise -- That's a good thing.

There are many ways you can pursue FIPS compliance -- large consulting firms, pre-validated software, open-source projects, or entirely in-house. Each of these approaches has its benefits and drawbacks, but without a neutral third party you may hear a lot more about the upsides than the downsides.

My goal is to learn your individual needs inside-and-out, and help you find the solution that truly meets your organization's needs.
